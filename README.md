## Abstract

"First Responder" is an innovative project developed to address the critical issue of prolonged 911 response times, which significantly exceed expected standards. The project focuses on:

- **Immediate Data Transmission**: Ensuring vital caller information reaches operators promptly, even if the call is disconnected.
- **AI-Powered Voice Assistant**: Engaging callers on hold to gather additional emergency details.
- **Streamlined Operator Interaction**: Providing operators with a succinct summary of vital information for faster responses.

Technical components include frontend (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), backend (MongoDB, Flask), and AI implementation (OpenAI and Google TTS APIs). Challenges involve precision in AI prompts and integration with existing 911 systems while maintaining data privacy standards.

Achievements include validating the concept of automated data sharing with 911 services, demonstrating its potential to enhance emergency response. The project highlights the transformative power of AI in improving emergency response times and effectiveness, with plans to expand AI capabilities for faster decision-making.
